#Inspiration

I created this website because this issue is really important to me, and it not only affects people locally but worldwide. This topic was inspired due to a crossover with my final project idea for WOMS314 which is Period Poverty and the best way to demonstrate this issues in a digital sphere. The best way I figured I could share it was through a website, so I decided to make it.
